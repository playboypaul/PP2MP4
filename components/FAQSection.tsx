  {
    question: "What file formats are supported?",
    answer: "Currently, we support .pptx (PowerPoint) files up to 50MB in size. We're working on adding support for .ppt, .odp, and other presentation formats in future updates."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the conversion process take?",
    answer: "Processing time depends on the number of slides and complexity of your presentation. Typically, it takes 2-5 minutes per slide. A 10-slide presentation usually completes within 15-20 minutes."
  },
  {
    question: "What video qualities and formats are available?",
    answer: "We offer multiple output options: 720p, 1080p, and 4K resolutions; aspect ratios of 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, and 9:16; frame rates of 24fps, 30fps, and 60fps. All videos are exported in MP4 format for maximum compatibility."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the Hollywood style effects?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Choose from Action, Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller, Romance, Comedy, and more genres. You can also add custom keywords to guide the AI's creative direction and select specific images from your slides."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my presentation data secure and private?",
    answer: "Yes, security is our top priority. All files are processed with end-to-end encryption, and we automatically delete your presentations and generated videos from our servers after 24 hours. We never store or share your content."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to create an account to use the service?",
    answer: "No account required! Simply upload your PowerPoint file and start converting immediately. However, creating an account allows you to save your preferences and access conversion history."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I download individual slide videos or the complete presentation?",
    answer: "Both options are available. You can download each slide as a separate MP4 file or combine all slides into one complete presentation video with smooth transitions between slides."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my presentation has animations or transitions?",
    answer: "Our AI analyzes existing animations and transitions, then recreates them with enhanced cinematic effects. Complex animations are interpreted and transformed into Hollywood-style visual sequences."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any usage limits or restrictions?",
    answer: "Free users can convert up to 3 presentations per day with a maximum of 20 slides each. Premium users enjoy unlimited conversions, priority processing, and access to exclusive Hollywood effects."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the generated videos commercially?",
    answer: "Yes, all generated videos are yours to use for any purpose, including commercial presentations, marketing materials, and social media content. You retain full rights to your converted videos."
